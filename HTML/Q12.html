  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build my web development skills.
  </p>

  
  <h3>My Goals</h3>
  <p>
    My goal is to become a full-stack developer and create useful applications that solve real-world problems.
  </p>

  
  <h4>Resources</h4>
  <p>
    I often refer to online resources to strengthen my knowledge. For example, I use 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>
    to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
